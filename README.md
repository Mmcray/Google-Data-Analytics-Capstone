# Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone
Project based off Divvy Cyclist Data following the Google data analytics process

The Notebook walks through the 6 steps of the Analysis process including data gathering, cleaning, organizing, visualizations and interpretation.

For this project I decided to use Python Pandas for my data handling and Tableau for vizualization.
